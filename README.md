<h2>Weekly Updates </h2>
<h3>Gautam & Dhruv</h3>
This week, Dhruv and I (Gautam) worked on the MyConnect aspect of our project. Dhruv added the extra functionality to the MyConnect interface that we wanted whereas I restructured the project into the different parts of the project we need for NATM. I also incorporated our minilabs into our Overflow repo.

<h2>Project Plan</h2>
<p> We plan to create a version of MyConnect but scaled down to a google calendar format which will also take into account a todo list that the user can create, add to, and remove items from </p>

The goal of this application is to support students and keep them on track and organized to ensure that the students are on track for assignments and due dates  
<h2> Project Features </h2>
<dl>
  <dt>MyConnect API Link</dt>
  <dd>Our application will link with the users existing MyConnect profile and will display assignments on the home screen of the application so that users can easily view all    assignments that have to be done</dd>
  <dt>ToDo</dt>  
  <dd>Our application will also support a in-app ToDo list that the user can make to supplement the MyConnect linked account so that the user can add specific items for their agenda</dd>

<h1>Week 2: Setting up a structure </h1>


<h2>Goals for this week</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Project Aspect</th>
    <th>Goal</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MyConnect</td>
    <td>Get the code to parse JSON working, and figure out how to access the url for JSON output</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ToDo</td>
    <td>Get a base webpage functioning, and figure out how to set up the database</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overall</td>
    <td>Get the file structure working correctly for Gradle, and orgainize the file structure. Also set up folders for additional web pages, and work on main page.</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<h2>Results and future goals</h2>
<p>We were able to complete all the goals we made this week, and are ready to move on to enhance what we already made, by bettering the HTML pages. Next week we hope to get some of the projects working, such as MyConnect. We also want to plan more features for the future to do with MyConnect, and ToDo, as currently both are only made to do one task respectively.</p>




<h1>Week 1: Set up </h1>
<h2>SMART Goals </h2>
<d1>
  <dt>S: Specific</dt>
  <dd>Create a seamless design that brings in MyConnect and also a ToDo feature that work together in harmony to create a application that will aide all students</dd>
  <dt>M: Measurable</dt>
  <dd>The progress of the project will be tracked through the progress board on Github. Each week, if each individual is able to complete individual assignments, it is a reflection that we are on track.</dd>
  <dt>A: Achievable</dt>
  <dd>This is a realistic goal as it is not too ambitious. We know that in the time frame, we won’t be able to replicate My Connect which is why we will create something that reflects just the TO-DO list feature from My Connect.</dd>
  <dt>R: Relevant</dt>
  <dd>This is a relevant project as the TO-DO feature is something that we have seen in our lives. It also complements the technical topics discussed in class as we’ll host the website on AWS and code in HTML/CSS.</dd>
  <dt>T: Time-bound</dt>
  <dd>We will project this to take 6 weeks (half a trimester) and will attempt to complete all our individual assignments by then. We will start from next week.</dd>
</d1>

<h2>SMART Goal Reflection </h2>
The most important goal we have is the stay on track and that is why we have created a <a href="https://github.com/batman084/Overflow/projects/1">Project Board</a> that we use to keep ourselves on track. This week, all members of the team worked on their invididual tasks, which were mainly focused on researching and learning about our individual assignments.

<h2>MiniLab Repo </h2>
All of our minilabs are accessible via this repo: <a href="https://github.com/batman084/Overflow-Minilabs">Overflow Minilabs</a>
